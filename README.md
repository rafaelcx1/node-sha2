# `sha2`

This Javascript module implements the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) cryptographic hash function family designed by _the United States National Security Agency (NSA)_.
It makes use of [the `crypto` standard built-in module](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/crypto.js) if the module is available (e.g. on Node.js), otherwise (e.g. on web browsers), an alternative Javascript implementation for SHA-2 that I developed is used.


## Installation ‚§ì

```
npm install sha2
```

or just download [the `SHA2.js`](./SHA2.js).


## API

.


## Example

.


## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

Making a hash of a password with one of the algorithms of the SHA-2 family and keeping it, is **not recommended**.
For that purpose, use slow hash functions which are slow by design such as [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2), [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bcrypt) and [scrypt](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html), instead.
